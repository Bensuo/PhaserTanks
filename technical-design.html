                <h2>Development Tools</h2>
                <p>The game is developed using JavaScript on the client and on the server through Node.js. Google Chrome
                    is the project’s main supported browser. </p>
                <p>Visual Studio Code has been used extensively during development of both client and server software.
                    The project makes use of Git for version control, with both client and server part of the same
                    repository to ensure that they are kept in sync. NPM is used to fetch and install the project’s
                    dependencies.</p>
                <p>The project depends upon numerous third party libraries. On the client, <a
                        href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser">Phaser 3</a> is used for input handling and
                    rendering. <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> is used for both client-side and server-side
                    networking. The <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> framework is used to create the web
                    server. The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gameloop">node-gameloop</a> is used to
                    create an efficient main application loop in our Node.js application. To process the level geometry
                    at runtime, the <a href="http://jsclipper.sourceforge.net/">jsClipper</a> library is used along with
                    <a href="https://github.com/morganherlocker/clipsy">Clipsy</a> and <a
                        href="https://github.com/sakri/MarchingSquaresJS">MarchingSquaresJS</a> on the server. <a
                        href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pngjs">Pngjs</a> is used for loading images on the server
                    and <a href="https://github.com/shakiba/planck.js">Planck.js</a> is used as the game’s physics
                    library.</p>
                <h2>General Constraints</h2>
                <p>There are several limitations and constraints that have impacted the design of the project. Time is
                    certainly the biggest factor, alongside software availability. The project had to be completed in a
                    little over two weeks due to the development team’s schedules. The project team consists of two
                    people, meaning careful time management and gameplay design choices were necessary to ensure the
                    project could be delivered.</p>


                <h2>Code Style</h2>
                <p>The codebase uses some ECMAScript 6 (ES6) features. The ES6 style of development is well <a
                        href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/">documented by Phaser</a>, so we decided to
                    implement our game’s scenes using classes. The client has been tested extensively on Chrome (version
                    73).
                </p>


                <h2>Development Methodology/Planning</h2>
                <p>Software development methodologies encourage a systemic approach towards development to improve the
                    quality of the final product. There was not a lot of time to create a forward plan for this project.
                    This meant that the project was implemented alongside additional research and experimentation, with
                    the design and requirements evolving over development. This means that a traditional linear project
                    management methodology, such as the Waterfall model, was unsuitable. Rewriting the project schedule
                    to compensate for new obstacles would have been very time consuming, which was unacceptable given
                    the time constraints the project already faced.
                </p>
                <p>While the project did not benefit from a rigid linear project plan, deadlines still needed to be met.
                    Development was broken into discrete tasks that could be completed over before moving to the next
                    issue. To ensure that the project was progressing as planned, the project was reassessed at the end
                    of each task. The development style could be described as a loose style of agile development.
