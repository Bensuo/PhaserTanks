        <h1>Game Design</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>“Is It Wrong to Fight in a Fish Tank?” is an online multiplayer artillery game. Players control an underwater
            tank and are tasked with destroying all of the other players. There can be between 2 and 4 players in a
            match.

            The game takes place in a fish tank, and is presented from a side-on perspective. Players control their tank
            using their mouse and keyboard. The tank can be moved using the WASD keys, where W and D will move the tank
            left and right, while A moves the tank up. Q rotates the tank left, while E rotates the tank right. Gravity
            will slowly draw the player to the bottom of the world, but because the setting is underwater gravity is
            more forgiving than typical artillery games. The tank will aim towards the player’s current mouse position
            on the screen. Clicking the left mouse button will make the tank fire a missile in the current aim
            direction. The projectile will follow a parabolic arc as the initial force carries it in the target
            direction and gravity acts upon it. When the missile hits a solid object, it will explode, destroying the
            terrain it touches and damaging any nearby players. When a player’s health reaches 0, they are removed from
            the match. The final surviving player is the victor.
        </p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The game concept borrows heavily from many games in the artillery game genre.

            The Worms series is a pivotal influence on the game’s design, introducing many gameplay mechanics that it
            borrows. The Worms games are turn-based artillery games where each player controls a team of worms. Each
            player takes a turn to control one of their worms, and may use whatever tools and weapons they have to try
            and attack and kill the enemy’s team. Most weapons in the game are ballistic, such as the series’ staple
            weapon the Bazooka. Players can fire explosive projectiles that destroy the environment and damage any
            players within the explosion radius.
        </p>
        <p>Death Tank is a 2D multiplayer game that takes the artillery-based gameplay of earlier titles, like Scorched
            Earth, and brings them to real-time. Terrain is also destructible, and eventually whittles down to a flat,
            indestructible plane. Unlike Worms, which puts emphasis on strategy through its many items and turn-based
            gameplay, Death Tank refocuses the artillery game to being about chaotic action.</p>
        <p>Our game draws upon these two games by taking the light-hearted cartoon stylings of Worms and marrying it to
            the streamlined real-time gameplay of Death Tank.</p>
        <h2>Game World</h2>
        <p>The game world is a fish tank. Players control tanks operated by fish, an allusion to the well-known joke:

            There’s two fish in a tank. One turns to the other and says ‘You man the guns, I’ll drive’.

            The tanks are very small, and the environment is made up of the aquarium décor; decorative rocks, ornaments,
            gravel and plants. These objects can be destroyed in the combat.
        </p>
        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>The game does not feature any developed characters. Players control unnamed fish that are piloting the tanks.
