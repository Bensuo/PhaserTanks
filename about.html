        <h1>Development Process</h1>
        <p>For a detailed overview of the development schedule and development process, please reference the commit
          history of the project's github repository.</p>
        <h1>Development Reflection</h1>
        <p>This project presented a number of key challenges: creating a game in a language the team had no experience
          with, using a language which is quite different from C based languages and creating a networked multiplayer
          game
          which we had no experience of previously. Working with Javascript and NodeJS has proved an interesting
          experience. In some cases it allowed for much more rapid iteration of ideas than in a language like C++,
          however
          due to the some extreme differences in concepts we often ran into issues with the use of the language that
          were
          difficult to solve. However, it has certainly been an interesting learning experience. Creating a networked
          multiplayer game was also a difficult challenge, although using libraries such as Socket.IO made some aspects
          trivial there is still a lot to consider with regards to management of states and especially the order of
          execution when dealing with asynchronous IO.</p>
        <p>Phaser3 provided similar benefits for the client, initially being very quick to get things running but often
          requiring lengthy investigation to solve issues. This was likely exacerbated by the fact that Phaser3 is still
          in development and has less resources available online and is subject to significant changes between versions.
          This was considered at the beginning of the project but it was decided that we would attempt to use it
          regardless. Overall, despite everything from the language to the libraries and frameworks being completely
          unfamiliar to the team we have managed to produce an interesting and well performing networked multiplayer
          game
          and consider this to be a good achievement.
        </p>
        <p>If given the chance to do this project over it is likely that it may benefit from stronger planning in the
          beginning stages of the project and more development time possibly allowing for important features like lag
          compensation.</p>
